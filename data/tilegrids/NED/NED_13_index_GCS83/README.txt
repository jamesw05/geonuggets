This shapefile contains an index for the NED (National Elevation Dataset) 1/3 Arc second (10 meter) dataset. The 'FILENAME' attribute corresponds to the folder/file name of the individual tiles. 
This index is based on the tiles obtained from the bulk data distribution program at the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science Center.  
This index will not work with custom extents downloaded from seamless.usgs.gov
